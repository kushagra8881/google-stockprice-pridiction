Google Stock Price Prediction Model using RNNN (Recurrent Neural Network with NLP)
Overview

This repository contains a stock price prediction model for Google using a Recurrent Neural Network with Natural Language Processing (RNNN). The model is designed to analyze historical stock data and make predictions about future stock prices based on patterns and trends identified in the data.

Introduction

The Google Stock Price Prediction Model is built using a Recurrent Neural Network with Natural Language Processing. The model processes historical stock data to identify patterns and trends, making it capable of predicting future stock prices. This README provides information on dependencies, installation, usage, model architecture, data, training, evaluation, and results.
Dependencies

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Jupyter Notebook (for development and visualization)

Install dependencies using:

bash

pip install tensorflow

Installation

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/kushagra0001/google-stock-pridiction.git
cd rnnn-google-stock-prediction



Usage

Follow these steps to use the Google Stock Price Prediction Model:

    Data Preparation: Ensure you have the historical stock data for Google (or modify the code to work with other stock data).

    Training: Run the training script to train the model on historical data.

    Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on future stock prices.

Refer to the Usage section in the documentation for detailed instructions.
Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of a Recurrent Neural Network with Natural Language Processing components to capture sequential dependencies and patterns in stock data. The architecture is detailed in the Model Architecture section of the documentation.
Data

The model requires historical stock data for Google. The data should include features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc. Ensure the data is preprocessed and formatted correctly.
Training

To train the model, execute the training script and provide the path to the historical stock data. The model will learn from the data and create a model checkpoint for future predictions.

bash

python train.py --data_path /path/to/stock_data.csv

Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script. This will provide metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.

bash

python evaluate.py --model_checkpoint /path/to/model_checkpoint
